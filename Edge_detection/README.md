# Horizontal and Vertical Edge Detection

This project has designs of two filters/kernels with size of 3x3 to detect all horizontal and vertical edges in an input image (HW3-Q3-image.jpg)

### Steps involved:
1. To make it easier, we first convert the image into gray scale using OpenCV.
2. The architecture only contains 1 convolutional layer, 1 pooling layer and 1 fully connected layer.
3. Implementation of convolution layer, pool layer and ReLU filter from scratch.
4. Visualizations of the output of the convolutional layer, the pooled layer and the ReLU activated convolutional layer (not the fully connected layer) for both kernels.
