# Comparitive study of Regression Models

The aim of this project is to implement a Linear Regressor and a Logistic Regressor using library methods and from scratch.

## Linear Regression using Scikit-learn and from scratch
Train a linear regression model for the Boston housing dataset:

Write python codes in a Jupyter notebook using the python library (sklearn.linear_model) and in another notebook implementing the gradient descent algorithm. Split the dataset to a training set (70% samples) and a testing set (30% samples). Print the root mean squared errors (RMSE) on the training and testing sets in the Jupyter notebook. 

## Logistic Regression using Scikit-learn and from scratch
Train a logistic regression model for the Titanic dataset:

Write python codes in a Jupyter notebook using the python library (sklearn.linear_model) and in another notebook implementing the gradient descent algorithm. Split the dataset to a training set (80% samples) and a testing set (20% samples). Print the overall classification accuracies on the training and testing sets and print the precision, recall, and F-measure scores for each of the two classes on the training and testing sets in the Jupyter notebook.
