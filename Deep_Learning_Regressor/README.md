# Deep Learning Regression Model

Implement a neural network to train a regression model for the Boston housing data set: https://towardsdatascience.com/linear-regression-on-boston-housing-dataset-f409b7e4a155

Split the dataset to a training set (70% samples) and a testing set (30% samples). Report the root mean squared errors (RMSE) on the testing sets.
* You have to use PyTorch deep learning library.
* Two hidden layers
  - The first hidden layer must contain 16 units using ReLU activation function
  - The second layer must contain 32 units using tanh activation function
