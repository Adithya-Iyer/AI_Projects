# Deep Learning Classification Model

Implement a neural network to train a classification model for the Titantic dataset: https://blog.goodaudience.com/machine-learning-using-logistic-regression-in-python-with-code-ab3c7f5f3bed.

Split the dataset to a training set (80% samples) and a testing set (20% samples). Report the overall classification accuracies on the training and testing sets and report the precision, recall, and F-measure scores for each of the two classes on the testing sets.
* You have to use PyTorch deep learning library.
* Two hidden layers
  - The first hidden layer must contain 5 units using ReLU activation function. 
  - The second layer must contain 3 units using tanh activation function.
