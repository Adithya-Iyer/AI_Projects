# Cliff Walking - Graph Traversal & Path Search

We attempt to solve the "cliff walking" problem and search the optimal path using the following graph traversal algorithms:

1. Depth-first search (DFS)
2. Breadth-first search (BFS)
3. Uniform Cost Search (UCS)
4. Greedy Search
5. A* Search Algorithm

The color of the cells represent the nature & cost of the regions:
* green/blue cells represent water region (cost=5) 
* white cells represent safe, non-water region (cost=1) 
* red cells represent cliff (game over)
